# Crow's Window Manager
A window manager for crows.

## Design Goals
* Tiling window management
* XMonad-style handling of multi monitor workspaces. Workspaces are shared among monitors, and a workspace only appears on one monitor at a time.
* Interfacing with the window manager is done through sending commands to a daemon, similar to bspwm
